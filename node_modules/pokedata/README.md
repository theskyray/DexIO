#  PokeData

Tool for exporting existing community Pokemon data to JSON using human-readable values.

The repository also comes with ready-to-use data, available in PHP array and JSON formats,
so it can be consumed by PHP projects or other projects that are not able to run PHP.

The project is easily extensible, so other export formats are also possible, e.g. YAML.

Installation and usage
----------------------

As a dependency of another PHP project, using composer:

```
composer require metaunicorn/pokedata:dev-master
```


If this repository is cloned manually:

```
composer install
```

> Note that the composer.lock file is distributed with the code, that's
because it's better to lock the veekun master reference so we won't
get undesired breaking changes.


To regenerate the JSON data (it will override existing one):

```
./pokedata generate [options]
```

> Execute `./pokedata generate --help` to see all available options. 

ToDo List
---------------------
Core:
- [x] Use Symfony console
- [x] Add JSON formatter
- [x] Add PHP Array formatter (better than var_export)
- [ ] Use CSV values instead of Enums (excepting Forme and Rank)

Competitive data:
- [x] Pokedex
- [x] Abilities
- [ ] Moves
- [ ] Items
- [ ] Learn Sets
- [ ] Descriptions (for everything)
- [ ] Competitive Move Sets (from Showdown repository)

Other data:
- [ ] Evolution chains
- [ ] Types, Natures, Habitats, ...
- [ ] Games, Regions and Locations, ...
